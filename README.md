# BetterCorrectors

_**!!! PROJECT IS NOT FINISHED YET, IT IS STILL WIP !!!**_

BetterCorrectors is a python project coded to find 'bad students' who made 'bad evaluations' during specified period of time.
The script returns a timestamp of when the evaluation took place and the login of the users who are responsible for this correction.
The definition of a bad evaluation is strictly personnal and could not fit your requirements, for more information about that, please read [pedagody](PEDAGO.md)
